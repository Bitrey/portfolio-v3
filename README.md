### Info

Client is done with Next.js, i18n with next-intl. Styling is all custom, using Tailwind CSS.

The server is very basic, it just provides the weather for Modena and the API route to send an email (in order to contact me). It is done with Node.js and Express. One day I might replace it with Bun.

### Installation and usage

Run `npm install` both on `client` and `server` directories, start frontend and backend server with `npm run dev`.
